<p style="margin:1em 0">Last weekend my dear friend Barış and I went down to Santa Cruz. I am slowly uncovering that Bay Area has an interesting geography, so an hour in the car is often all it takes to go from snow-bright ridgelines to a beach with glitter on the water. <br/><br/>We found a great coffee spot, and let the ocean do that reset thing it does.</p><table style="width:100%;border:0;border-collapse:collapse"><tr><td style="vertical-align:top;border:0"><figure style="margin:1.5em 0"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/setrf/blog-assets/main/posts/on-bananas-and-tourists-from-the-matrix/images/image-2608d6e5-2608d6e5.jpeg" alt="image" style="width:100%;height:auto;display:block;margin:0 auto"/></figure></td><td style="vertical-align:top;border:0"><figure style="margin:1.5em 0"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/setrf/blog-assets/main/posts/on-bananas-and-tourists-from-the-matrix/images/image-2608d6e5-2608d6e5.jpeg" alt="image" style="width:100%;height:auto;display:block;margin:0 auto"/></figure></td></tr></table><p style="margin:1em 0">Back home that night I scrolled through our shots while my tech-infested timeline kept feeding me demos and papers. That is when the thought landed. We had driven an hour to change the backdrop. With the newest tools popping out I could be even faster.</p><p style="margin:1em 0">I had been playing with Nano Banana (a compact image model that shocked the community, later revealed to be <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemini-2-5-flash-image/">Gemini 2.5 Flash Image</a>). Same hair and earrings, same jacket and little quirks, carried from one scene to the next. It felt like moving a paper cutout version of a person across a stack of postcards.</p><p style="margin:1em 0">That tugged a thread back to the StyleGAN era. StyleGAN introduced a style-based generator that separates high-level attributes like identity and pose from finer stochastic detail, which is why you can tweak one without wrecking the other. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948">The original paper </a>spells this out and shows how the architecture improves interpolation and disentanglement across scales.</p><p style="margin:1em 0">Around the same time, thispersondoesnotexist turned that research into a cultural moment. <a href="https://tomroelandts.com/articles/this-person-does-not-exist">Tom Roelandts has a clear explainer</a> of how GANs pit a generator against a discriminator and why that feedback loop can produce such convincing faces, while also noting the little quirks you sometimes spot on a hard refresh.</p><p style="margin:1em 0">There is a serious footnote too. Research has shown that identity information can leak from training data into synthetic faces, even without malicious intent. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05084">The WACV 2021 paper “This Face Does Not Exist … But It Might Be Yours!” </a>evaluated StyleGAN2 generations with several matchers and found evidence of identity leakage. That reminder sits in the back of my head whenever I tinker. </p><p style="margin:1em 0">So I gave myself a small quest. By the powers granted to me by the long-weekend, a generous API access from Google, and Github Student Pack’s DigitalOcean credits loaded on to a 5 USD VPS (and Codex CLI loaded on to it), I rolled up my sleeves.</p><p style="margin:1em 0">I spun up the tiny DigitalOcean VPS droplet, pointed a simple pipeline at a batch of synthetic faces, curated a list of famous landmarks, and asked Nano Banana to place a consistent character into each scene. Keep it lightweight. Keep it playful. Avoid repeating the same face with the same place so the tour feels fresh.</p><p style="margin:1em 0">With a little bit of back-and-forth, <a href="https://thistouristdoesnotexist.com/"><strong>thistouristdoesnotexist</strong></a> was live. </p><p style="margin:1em 0">Refresh, and a synthetic traveler appears at a landmark. Refresh again, and another character shows up somewhere new. It feels like a scrapbook from a parallel trip never taken.</p><table style="width:100%;border:0;border-collapse:collapse"><tr><td style="vertical-align:top;border:0"><figure style="margin:1.5em 0"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/setrf/blog-assets/main/posts/on-bananas-and-tourists-from-the-matrix/images/image-2608d6e5-2608d6e5.png" alt="image" style="width:100%;height:auto;display:block;margin:0 auto"/></figure></td><td style="vertical-align:top;border:0"><figure style="margin:1.5em 0"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/setrf/blog-assets/main/posts/on-bananas-and-tourists-from-the-matrix/images/image-2608d6e5-2608d6e5.png" alt="image" style="width:100%;height:auto;display:block;margin:0 auto"/></figure></td></tr></table><p style="margin:1em 0">A few things stood out while I was play-testing:</p><ul style="margin:1em 0;padding-left:2em"><li style="margin:0.5em 0">Character identity holds steady from scene to scene. Hair, accessories, and proportions carry over.</li><li style="margin:0.5em 0">Architecture survives with more fidelity than I expected. Domes, arches, filigree, and skyline edges read as the real location rather than a generic backdrop.</li><li style="margin:0.5em 0">Poses and light usually make sense. The stance looks like a tourist pose, shadows fall in the right direction, and reflections often line up with the environment.</li></ul><p style="margin:1em 0">There are wobbles. A stray hand blends into a railing. A face drifts slightly. I smile when that happens, because it reminds me that these tourists are stitched from matrix multiplications on a TPU, not post-cards from a friend.</p><p style="margin:1em 0">The Bay Area makes quick physical travel feel normal. Tools like this make quick imaginary travel feel normal too. I am not trying to replace the feeling of wind on the pier in Santa Cruz. I am sketching with photons and letting a virtual traveler hop from the Hagia Sophia to Chichén Itzá in seconds.</p><p style="margin:1em 0">Have fun sending these virtual people on a joyride around the world. If you find a favorite, I would love to see it!</p>
